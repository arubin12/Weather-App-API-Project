# Weather-App-API-Project
This is a proof of concept JavaScript project that uses the Accuweather CitySearch and CurrentConditions API's to create a responsive app that will display the current weather conditions of any city that is input.

In order to run this project, download or clone the repository and run index.html with a live server. The project has a limit of 50 querys per day because of limitations of the accuweather API.
